OSeMOSYS was introduced in 2008 [(1)](#1) in the grey literature (and in peer-reviewed literature in 2011 [(2)](#2)). It sparked a revolution in open-source energy modeling systems. Unlike earlier models that demanded coding expertise, relied on existing codebases, or required costly software like GAMS, OSeMOSYS was developed from scratch and features a user-friendly Excel interface.

It has emerged as the preferred choice for academics, with Scopus data showing it supports nearly double the peer-reviewed publications of other open-source models cumulatively and annually [(3)](#3). This widespread adoption stems from its accessible code, intuitive interface [(4)](#4), and a dynamic community of analysts who have published in leading journals, including *Science* [(5)](#5) and *Nature Journals* [(6-10)](#6).

Far from being just a sector-coupled electricity model, OSeMOSYS is a versatile model generator, enabling innovative applications such as the worldâ€™s first open-source, open-data global electricity model [(6)](#6) and national-level multi-domain Climate-, Land-, Energy-, and Water-systems (CLEWs) models [(11)](#11).

A summary of its recent advancements is available in a recent publication [(12)](#12).
