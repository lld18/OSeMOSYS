      The <strong>Climate, Land, Energy and Water Systems (CLEWs)</strong> framework represents a sophisticated approach to modern resource management that has emerged as a vital tool for understanding complex environmental interactions. At its core, CLEWs acknowledges that decisions made about one resource inevitably impact others - for instance, changes in energy production methods can significantly affect water usage and land requirements, while simultaneously influencing climate change outcomes.</p>

      <p class="alt-lead text-gray text-justify-between col-md-15 mx-auto" style="text-align: justify; font-size: 0.875em;">
      Since its emergence in the early 2010s, CLEWs has established itself as a methodology that enables comprehensive analysis of resource interactions, particularly within the context of achieving <strong>Sustainable Development Goals</strong>. The framework's strength lies in its ability to capture and analyze the intricate relationships between different environmental systems, providing decision-makers with a more complete picture of resource management challenges and opportunities.

        <p class="alt-lead text-gray text-justify-between col-md-15 mx-auto" style="text-align: justify; font-size: 0.875em;">
      The framework has gained significant institutional support, with organizations like the <strong>United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)</strong> and the <strong>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</strong> taking leading roles in its promotion and implementation. These organizations have been particularly active in building capacity in developing nations, recognizing that effective resource management is crucial for sustainable development in the Global South.

        Implementation of CLEWs relies on sophisticated modeling tools, with <strong>OSeMOSYS</strong> and <strong>LEAP</strong> being among the primary platforms used. These tools allow for detailed analysis of resource interactions and help predict the outcomes of various management decisions. However, the technical complexity of these tools presents ongoing challenges.
